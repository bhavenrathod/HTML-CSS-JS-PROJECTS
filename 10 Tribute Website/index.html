            <b>Steven Paul Jobs</b> (February 24, 1955 – October 5, 2011) was an
            American business magnate, inventor, and investor. He was the
            co-founder, chairman, and CEO of Apple; the chairman and majority
            shareholder of Pixar; a member of The Walt Disney Company's board of
            directors following its acquisition of Pixar; and the founder,
            chairman, and CEO of NeXT. He was a pioneer of the personal computer
            revolution of the 1970s and 1980s, along with his early business
            partner and fellow Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak. Jobs was born in
            San Francisco to a Syrian father and German-American mother. He was
            adopted shortly after his birth. Jobs attended Reed College in 1972
            before withdrawing that same year. In 1974, he traveled through
            India seeking enlightenment before later studying Zen Buddhism. He
            and Wozniak co-founded Apple in 1976 to sell Wozniak's Apple I
            personal computer. Together the duo gained fame and wealth a year
            later with production and sale of the Apple II, one of the first
            highly successful mass-produced microcomputers. Jobs saw the
            commercial potential of the Xerox Alto in 1979, which was
            mouse-driven and had a graphical user interface (GUI). This led to
            the development of the unsuccessful Apple Lisa in 1983, followed by
            the breakthrough Macintosh in 1984, the first mass-produced computer
            with a GUI. The Macintosh introduced the desktop publishing industry
            in 1985 with the addition of the Apple LaserWriter, the first laser
            printer to feature vector graphics.
